Hello and welcome to Tandem!

1. Make sure that you leave all HTML, .gif, .png, and .jpg in the main folder. An assets folder will be created soon!
2. Create a folder named 'css' and put all css documents inside. 
3. Create a folder named 'js' and put all javascript documents inside. 
4. For the readme, you can leave that out for now!
